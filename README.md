# ServerGenerator

Uses random word API - https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/word?number=1 - to get a word , then puts it onto discord.gg/ and sends it through a webhook.

You can then check if you guessed a vanity url link for a server and join it if you want to :shrug:

Might take some time but I can confirm this finds a few.

Uses: kinda pointless but might be amusing if your tryna find servers to hang out in idk
